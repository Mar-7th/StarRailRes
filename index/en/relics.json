In her lonely odyssey, Oakley could fall asleep with her head pillowed on her felt hat whenever she was near a bonfire. All her dreams were intruded by a mysterious gunslinger, who claimed to be a bounty hunter from afar. His scrawny figure was in sharp contrast with his fiercely stern gaze.

                    "backstory": "Madam Herta was once very troubled by the huge collection of items spread across the galaxy. Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.\\n\\nThe generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.\\n\\nThe IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.\\n\\nMost of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.\\n\\nHowever, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nLight from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.\\n\\nDespite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The galaxy was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection.",

Relying on the security personnel hired by the IPC and a somewhat advanced defensive system proved insufficient to handle the hostility from the stars... Madam Herta once made prescient judgment and steered the station away in an elegant curve, ending a conspiratorial attempt to assault the station before it even initiated.\\n\\nAs for her mastery in gathering intel to solve crises, she simply described it as \"I spend time brewing coffee while others are reading books.\"\\n\\nRather than thieves who intend to steal its collection or mysterious factions with unknown objectives, the main threat faced by the space station remains its owner. The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.\\n\\nHence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.\\n\\nSenior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.\\n\\nThe space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue.

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.\\n\\nAfter voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of the Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.\\n\\nThose who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.\\n\\nYet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.\\n\\nIn the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The Foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.\\n\\nProsperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.\\n\\nImmortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity.

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.\\n\\nHowever, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.\\n\\nThe celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.\\n\\nIn desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.\\n\\nIt attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of the Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.\\n\\nFortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Galaxy-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe.

Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.\\n\\nToday, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the galaxy.

The ships full of treasures from distant stars passed the Aeon Qlipoth countless times like fireflies, and yet the Aeon remained as silent as before.\\n\\nThe building materials accumulated since the time of the support team piled up on every planet around the Aeon Qlipoth, and the amount will only increase. The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the Galaxy. They gaze upon the headless colossus, never once feeling that their efforts were in vain.\\n\\n\"All the toil and growth of our capital is for Qlipoth, and to execute the Aeon's will when the time comes.\"",

This crystal clear mineral contained energy that served as the lifeblood of industrialization, and their amber-colored reflections sparked with the Preservation's light.

The Destruction's catastrophic Legion descended from the sky, and the flames of war surged across the lands. The Architects built defensive walls and fortifications, and hundred-meter constructs contended with draconian monstrosities... Then, an unending cold front suddenly appeared, and a chilling blizzard swallowed friend and foe alike. The whole planet was shrouded in utter silence, with an invisible spatial barrier covered a single fortress city, like the flame of a candle being protected in a person's embrace during a cold night.

                    "backstory": "Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance.\\n\\nElectric currents flow throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.\\n\\nA mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.\\n\\nHowever, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.\\n\\nIn the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.\\n\\nWith their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.\\n\\nThe massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.\\n\\nThe steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits. They will continue to ponder and explore their origins until the ever-present mechanical sun completely burns out.",

The event of understanding the operation logic of Planet Screwllum did not even cause any exceptional fluctuations in his Intelligent Pulse Waveform.\\n\\nHe stood on the wide terrace of his mansion, looking up at the unstoppable planetary engine. The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder — that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.\\n\\nAccording to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.\\n\\nScrewllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons. Automatons were always made up of many smaller automatons, going back to the smallest components that form the building blocks of the universe. What was the smallest component? No one knows. Neither Screwllum nor the scholar who first proposed building the Celestial Differentiator do.\\n\\nThat was why Screwllum felt empty.\\n\\nDid that scholar's attempt fail? But the Celestial Differentiator had worked tirelessly for many Amber Eras. Did that not mean that the origin of the Screwllumites, their parent star, and even the entire universe can be attributed to that elegant string of equations? Not really. Until the super-ecosystem collapsed entirely, the equations remained unfalsifiable.\\n\\nHe swirled the fine glass of machine oil, never taking his eyes off the ring that recorded the truth of the planet. The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. Do ends to recursions really exist? He thought. What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?\\n\\nAm I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?\\n\\n\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

The long-lasting impact caused by the Meteoric Starfall relentlessly hitting the planet at such a particular angle caused the planet's rotation to gradually come to a halt. It was like pushing a world-deactivate button. Salsotto's days and nights became longer and longer, until every sunrise and sunset would last for a seeming eternity, until nobody could take it any longer, until the whole planet's rotation was finally brought to a standstill...\\n\\nIt had become a fact of life that sizzling summers under the scorching sun and dark nights of bitter coldness would last for half a year. What was left of the whole Salsotto were the last two remaining cities that were moving non-stop, always running right after the terminator line.\\n\\nThe colossal fortress was floating in the air like a gargantuan raincloud, slowly hovering across the sky above the golden desert with thundering noise. Wherever it went, overwhelming storms of sand were cascading down and over. In the giant moving city, the Salsottians in winged suits were flying up and down among the city's buildings. These flying folks who had survived the calamity by sheer luck now belonged to the sky and were bound to it at the same time.\\n\\nIn the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead.\\n\\nEven though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line.\\n\\nGradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned.

The line of dawn and dusk swept across the earth, climbed over mountains and ravines, brought dawn to those still awake, and sent sunset to those who would soon sleep... But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk.\\n\\nClimbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind.\\n\\nThe pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights.\\n\\nHowever, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall, and the ruins of the once mobile city were eventually left far behind by the ever-shifting terminator line.\\n\\nYears later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would finally stand against each other, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which merged with unnameable hatred and morphed together into the same ruins.\\n\\nPlanet Salsotto kept its silence.

The planet-destroying wars of the past brought mountains upon mountains of ruins and wreckage onto the surface of Talia, resulting in imperishable radiation and taking away the last remaining hope to sustain life. The thieves had nowhere else to go and fell into a cave beneath the surface of the planet, which turned out to be a tunnel left by the rodent race... The thieves managed a narrow escape, and their dream of establishing a Kingdom of Banditry was thus discreetly born in this lost realm of seclusion.\\n\\nInnumerable caverns were interconnected in a massive labyrinth. More groups of thieves and bandits were lured in by this supposed dreamland meant for them and came to accumulate wealth and exchange technology, subsequently laying the foundation for the kingdom.\\n\\nAs more and more thieves and bandits settled down here, the once desolate planet became extraordinarily bustling with life. Thieves of great renown spoke of their ideal of a Kingdom of Banditry, promising to use the treasury to build a nation of equity and fairness. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves tore up their flimsy promises right away and attempted to monopolize all the wealth. Mercenaries, riots, double crossings, and betrayals... Chaos ensued one after another. Perhaps the initiators never even once believed in their ideal of so-called equity for all.\\n\\nHenceforth, thieves who resented lofty ideals found themselves in a chaotic age where ignorance was glorified. They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice.\\n\\nEveryone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.\\n\\nIn a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction.",

It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.\\n\\nThe entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...\\n\\nThis exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.\\n\\nThe top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.\\n\\nThis naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.\\n\\nIt was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.\\n\\nThere was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times.",

The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.\\n\\nHowever, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.\\n\\nThe great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.\\n\\nThe fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.\\n\\nEvery sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.\\n\\nThus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change.",

                    "description": "On the coastline of Wacq Island, tidal waves rose and fell... This landscape remained the same for millennia and witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations just like those changing tides.",
                    "backstory": "The fruits of the Thestang tree matured and fell to the ground, giving birth to creatures of all kinds. Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.\\n\\nAt first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.\\n\\nAs the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.\\n\\nWhen the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.\\n\\nThe demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.\\n\\nThe sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.\\n\\nThe coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration.",
